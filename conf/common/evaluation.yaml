deterministic: true   # Ensures the policy uses deterministic actions (i.e., no exploration noise).
record_video: true    # Enables video recording of agent behavior during evaluation.
n_episodes: 10       # Number of evaluation episodes to average results over.
video_freq: 100        # Frequency at which evaluation videos are recorded (e.g., every 10 episodes).
save_metrics: true    # Saves evaluation metrics (e.g., mean reward, success rate) to a file for analysis.
